# A photographer's portfolio page

# Techs used:
1. html
2. css
3. js;
4. react;

# Link to the actual website:
https://ninaka.ge/
# Link:
https://gigatokhishvili.github.io/niniclone/

# Posibilities:
1. a basic portfolio page for users, they can scroll down to each section to see pictures and they can switch between different pages from the menu at the top.
2. The person the website belongs to(my sister) can upload images to firebase and those exact images are fetched to the web page.

# What I learned:
1. A lot of practice in react;
2. Firebase. What it is, how to upload and download images, how to log in and out for users, etc.. Altough later I decided for safety and practical reasons not to implement these function on the actual page and instead used them here - https://gigatokhishvili.github.io/Learning-Firebase/.
3. Learned a lot about controlling scroll animation both trough js and css.
